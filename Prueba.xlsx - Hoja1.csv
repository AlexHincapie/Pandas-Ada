Hence, implementing Industry 4.0 is becoming essentially the new age solution for industrial operations. This study attempts to categorise the important technological enablers for the Indian manufacturing industry in implementing Industry 4.0. In this context, 14 selected and identified enablers, namely Visual Computing, Big Data, Product Life Cycle Management, Supply Chain, Top Level Management, Collaborative Productivity, Internet of Things, Horizontal and Vertical Integration, Mass Customisation, Cyber-Physical System, Additive Manufacturing, Professional Training and Development, Networked Manufacturing Systems and Operational Efficiency, are identified through the review of literature and expert’s opinion for implementing Industry 4.0. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) methodology is employed to appreciate the mutual relationships among the identified enablers. Furthermore, contextual interactions among the enablers are established by brainstorming with experts. The identified 14 technological enablers are further classified as dependent and driving factors. Later, the validation of the factors is done by MICMAC analysis. The interactions amongst these enablers will help the manufacturing organisations to prioritise and administer these factors efficiently and effectively to reap benefits during the implementation of Industry 4.0. Therefore, this study analyses the enablers to implement Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing industries. Also, it develops an interpretive framework that will help understand the interdependence of the enablers. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",enablers; Industry 4.0; ISM approach; manufacturing industry; MICMAC analysis

In the area of custom production processes, there may also be circumstances of organizational management where compliance with labor productivity and the due-date principle is problematic. Similar products with different operating times cause the throughput of assembly lines to slow down, increase number of works in progress (WIP), and increase productivity waste. It is possible to reduce this impact through various productivity-enhancing methods and innovations. This paper presents an innovative approach to product segmentation in the assembly phase of custom manufacturing, and a proposal for a new segmentation procedure that will allow significantly better integration of products into existing assembly processes without negatively impacting the company's production indicators. The scientific problem was defined on the basis that extending existing segmentation by the third dimension of operating times allows products in MTO (made to order) environments to be divided into families with approximately equal operating times. This will increase assembly efficiency in existing medium to large companies without large investments in the development and adaptation of assembly process products. The contributions of this work relate mainly to simple adaptations to existing processes in medium-sized businesses. The proposed solution respects the basic elements of Industry 4.0. © 2019 by the authors.",Adaptive assembly; Operating times; Product segmentation; Sustainable manufacturing

With the advantages of high-tech devices and solutions such as IPCs, industrial automation and machine automation technologies, hardware-software integration and various others, it is now possible to foster the development of Industry 4.0 through three logical steps. The first step considers the implementation of equipment connectivity: devices, machines, production lines and factories are connected to the system, and therefore, data transparency as well as information visualization can be obtained. In addition, the second step involves data collection and integration, as well as valued-added products and services that are introduced for smart manufacturing services. Lastly, the third step of intelligent innovative services is the enabling of intelligent machinery and big data analysis. Given the aforementioned, smart factory can be defined as a factory which harmonically implements Machine Automation, Equipment Monitoring & Optimization, Machine Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance, MES Integration & Production Traceability, Factory Energy Management System and Factory Environment Monitoring – developed with integrated automation and cloud innovation for industry 4.0. Having in mind that the aim of this paper is to review the possibilities and concerns of Energy Management in Industry 4.0 Ecosystem, this topic will be devoted to the greatest attention, while the importance of other equally relevant topics that are simply not the subject of this review should not be diminished or underestimated. © 2018, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

Ciberseguridad,2,"Wani T.A., Mendoza A., Gray K.",Hospital Bring-your-own-device security challenges and solutions: Systematic review of gray literature,2020,"0,585597358","Background: As familiarity with and convenience of using personal devices in hospitals help improve the productivity, efficiency, and workflow of hospital staff, the health care bring-your-own-device (BYOD) market is growing consistently. However, security concerns owing to the lack of control over the personal mobile devices of staff, which may contain sensitive data such as personal health information of patients, make it one of the biggest health care information technology (IT) challenges for hospital administrations. Objective: Given that the hospital BYOD security has not been adequately addressed in peer-reviewed literature, the aim of this paper was to identify key security challenges associated with hospital BYOD usage as well as relevant solutions that can cater to the identified issues by reviewing gray literature. Therefore, this research will provide additional practical insights from current BYOD practices. Methods: A comprehensive gray literature review was conducted, which followed the stepwise guidelines and quality assessment criteria set out by Garousi et al. The searched literature included tier 1 sources such as health care cybersecurity market reports, white papers, guidelines, policies, and frameworks as well as tier 2 sources such as credible and reputed health IT magazines, databases, and news articles. Moreover, a deductive thematic analysis was conducted to organize the findings based on Schlarman's People Policy Technology model, promoting a holistic understanding of hospitals' BYOD security issues and solutions. Results: A total of 51 sources were found to match the designed eligibility criteria. From these studies, several sociotechnical issues were identified. The major challenges identified were the use of devices with insufficient security controls by hospital staff, lack of control or visibility for the management to maintain security requirements, lack of awareness among hospital staff, lack of direction or guidance for BYOD usage, poor user experience, maintenance of legal requirements, shortage of cybersecurity skills, and loss of devices. Although technologies such as mobile device management, unified endpoint management, containerization, and virtual private network allow better BYOD security management in hospitals, policies and people management measures such as strong security culture and staff awareness and training improve staff commitment in protecting hospital data. Conclusions: The findings suggest that to optimize BYOD security management in hospitals, all 3 dimensions of the security process (people, policy, and technology) need to be given equal emphasis. As the nature of cybersecurity attacks is becoming more complex, all dimensions should work in close alignment with each other. This means that with the modernization of BYOD technology, BYOD strategy, governance, education, and relevant policies and procedures also need to adapt accordingly. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

However, as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Internet-based standard communication protocol is used, external network contacts are created, which is accompanied by security vulnerabilities from various perspectives. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop an appropriate cybersecurity guideline that enables effective reactions to cybersecurity threats caused by the abuse of such defects. Unfortunately, it is not easy for each organization to develop an adequate cybersecurity guideline. Thus, the cybersecurity checklist proposed by a government organization is used. The checklist does not fully reflect the characteristics of each infrastructure network. In this study, we proposed a cybersecurity framework that reflects the characteristics of a microgrid network in the IIoT environment, and performed an analysis to validate the proposed framework.

One of the most emerging technologies of the 21st century is blockchain. It is a revolution for the digital world as it brings a new perspective of security, efficiency, and productivity of different frameworks. It works as a distributed database that is shared among a decentralized network of computers. It stores information about the transaction that is made with cryptocurrency and is maintained with the help of different computers which are linked in a peer-to-peer network. No single user can control the transactions, but everyone can inspect it. The information about the transactions is assembled as a 'block' and these blocks are linked with each other as a 'chain'. That's why it is called blockchain. The information inside blocks is immutable. The technology of blockchain is so efficient that it is not only used in securing financial information but also in credit history, real estate, public transport, music streaming, healthcare and so forth. According to Don and Alex Tapscott (2016), blockchain records not just financial transactions but virtually everything valuable. Currently, there is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications. The purpose of the research paper is to discuss some of the utilization of blockchain and they are Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), Fintech, Cloud Storage, Media, Travel, and Education. Furthermore, this paper examines both aspects, advantages, and disadvantages, of the blockchain. Finally, it identifies the problem areas of the technology that can be studied further to increase the effectiveness of blockchain. © 2019 IEEE.",Blockchain; Cloud storage; Cybersecurity; Education; Fintech; IoT; Media; Travel

,2,"Gordon K., Birnbaum Z., Davis M., Dolgikh A.",ACE: Advanced CIP evaluator,2018,"0,04837770618","Industrial control systems (ICS) are key enabling systems that drive the productivity and efficiency of omnipresent industries such as power, gas, water treatment, transportation, and manufacturing. These systems consist of interconnected components that communicate over industrial networks using industrial protocols such as the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP). CIP is one of the most commonly used network-based process control protocols, and utilizes an object-oriented communication structure for device to device interaction. Due to this object-oriented structure, CIP communication reveals detailed information about the devices, the communication patterns, and the system, providing an in-depth view of the system. The details from this in-depth system perspective can be utilized as part of a system cybersecurity or discovery approach. However, due to the variety of commands, corresponding parameters, and variable layer structure of the CIP network layer, processing this layer is a challenging task. This paper presents a tool, Advanced CIP Evaluator (ACE), which passively processes the CIP communication layer and automatically extracts device, communication, and system information from observed network traffic. ACE was tested and verified using a representative ICS power generation testbed. Since ACE operates passively, without generating any network traffic of its own, system operations are not disturbed. This novel tool provides ICS information, such as networked devices, communication patterns, and system operation, at a depth and breadth that is unique compared with other known tools. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Common industrial protocol; Industrial control systems; Passive network analysis

Due to the heterogeneous and growing biomedical big datasets, cloud computing services offer an opportunity to mitigate the associated storage and analysis requirements. Having on-demand network access to a shared pool of flexible computing resources creates a consolidated system that should reduce potential duplications of effort in military biomedical research. Methods: Interactive, online literature searches were performed with Google, at the Defense Technical Information Center, and at two National Institutes of Health research portfolio information sites. References cited within some of the collected documents also served as literature resources. Results: We gathered, selected, and reviewed DoD and other government cloud computing policies and guidances published from 2009 to 2017. These policies were intended to consolidate computer resources within the government and reduce costs by decreasing the number of federal data centers and by migrating electronic data to cloud systems. Initial White House Office of Management and Budget information technology guidelines were developed for cloud usage, followed by policies and other documents from the DoD, the Defense Health Agency, and the Armed Services. Security standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Government Services Administration, the DoD, and the Army were also developed. Government Services Administration and DoD Inspectors General monitored cloud usage by the DoD. A 2016 Government Accountability Office report characterized cloud computing as being economical, flexible and fast. A congressionally mandated independent study reported that the DoD was active in offering a wide selection of commercial cloud services in addition to its milCloud system. Our findings from the Department of Health and Human Services indicated that the security infrastructure in cloud services may be more compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 regulations than traditional methods. To gauge the DoD's adoption of cloud technologies proposed metrics included cost factors, ease of use, automation, availability, accessibility, security, and policy compliance. Conclusions: Since 2009, plans and policies were developed for the use of cloud technology to help consolidate and reduce the number of data centers which were expected to reduce costs, improve environmental factors, enhance information technology security, and maintain mission support for service members. Cloud technologies were also expected to improve employee efficiency and productivity. Federal cloud computing policies within the last decade also offered increased opportunities to advance military healthcare. It was assumed that these opportunities would benefit consumers of healthcare and health science data by allowing more access to centralized cloud computer facilities to store, analyze, search and share relevant data, to enhance standardization, and to reduce potential duplications of effort. We recommend that cloud computing be considered by DoD biomedical researchers for increasing connectivity, presumably by facilitating communications and data sharing, among the various intra-and extramural laboratories. We also recommend that policies and other guidances be updated to include developing additional metrics that will help stakeholders evaluate the above mentioned assumptions and expectations. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.",avoiding duplication; big data; collaboration; cost reduction; cybersecurity; data consolidation; data sharing; standardization

A major challenge is to develop applications with high computing potential with limited resources. To satisfy both high-level performance and low-power requirements, a deep characterization method for microcontrollers is proposed since selecting the appropriate device is a central pillar of smart energy policy. The high-level analysis investigates the potential of various low-power microcontrollers with a benchmark utilizing a periodic duty cycle model of typical WSN applications. Afterward, deep characterization was carried out in two steps. The preselection phase is based on estimation whose results will serve as input for the second measurement phase. A highly accurate four-wire measurement involving guarding and shielding of all interfaces and the measurement cave is used for all measurements. To make the results comparable, a normalized power, defined as a measure of power per throughput, is introduced.

Yet we understand little about the influences of such quantification of work on workers’ behavior and performance. This article investigates how and when quantification of work affects worker productivity. We argue that quantification affects worker productivity via auto-gamification, or workers’ inadvertent transformation of work into an independent, individual-level game. We further argue that quantification is likely to raise productivity in a context of simple work, where auto-gamification is motivating because quantified metrics adequately measure the work being performed. When work is complex, by contrast, quantification reduces productivity because quantified metrics cannot adequately measure the multifaceted work being performed, causing auto-gamification to be demotivating. To substantiate our argument, we study implementation of an RFID measurement technology that quantifies individual workers’ output in real time at a garment factory in India. Qualitative evidence uncovers the auto-gamification mechanism and three conditions that enable it; a natural experiment tests the consequences of quantification of work for worker productivity. This article contributes to the study of quantification, work games, technology, and organizations, and we explore the policy implications of further quantification of work. © American Sociological Association 2020.",games; organizational performance; organizations; quantification; work

Its complete definition covers productivity, ability and accessibility. In remote and less developed areas, food supply mainly depends on self-sufficiency rather than regional commercial trade. Given limited resources, it is necessary to evaluate agricultural production in this kind of area, so as to improve long-term and stable food production to achieve food security. Heihe River Basin (HRB) is famous for its arid and semi-arid climate, as it is located in the inland of Northwest China. Taking the Heihe River Basin as case study area, we analyzed the total factor productivity of 11 counties of the HRB over 1990–2012. Further, agricultural production efficiency was estimated based on Data Envelopment Analysis and the Malmquist index, in which four input indicators (sown area, agriculture and farm labor, general agricultural machine power and fertilizer) and one output indicator (gross agricultural production) were taken into consideration. The results showed that agricultural production was unbalanced in the HRB for the entire period between 1990 and 2012. The agricultural scale efficiency remained basically unchanged in the HRB, and technical change was the main influencing factor on agricultural production. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Agricultural production efficiency; Big data; Data Envelopment Analysis; Food security; Heihe River Basin; Malmquist index; Total factor productivity

Large breweries implemented the use of sensors and digitization before smaller ones among which are craft breweries. Internet of Beer (IoB) technologies are becoming accessible to mid and small sized brewing companies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to review mainly low-cost IoB smart technologies that can be implemented from the mash to the final product and its service, to improve the brewing production, control, delivery, and final quality increasing profitability. The reviewed applications were retrieved both from the scientific databases and from the web. The work is structured in three macro areas such as beer processing, product logistics and traceability, and service. The results show a future trend characterized by a very fast increase in the use of IoB (also open source) systems to drive efficiency, productivity, quality, and safety. This will be done by real-time monitoring and a data-driven decision support system (DSS). Crucial aspects needing further investigation are data ownership and data standardization. The access price of IoB devices and software is destined for a significant decrease while their diversification on the market will grow leading to a massive future implementation within all the production levels. © 2020 by the authors.

However, they have also seen resistance from different groups claiming that they are unsafe, pose a risk of being hacked, will threaten jobs, and increase environmental pollution from increased driving as a result of their convenience. In order to reap the benefits of SDVs, while avoiding some of the many pitfalls, it is important to effectively determine what challenges we will face in the future and what steps need to be taken now to avoid them. The approach taken in this paper is the construction of a likely future (the year 2025), through the process of a policy scenario methodology, if we continue certain trajectories over the coming years. The purpose of this is to articulate issues we currently face and the construction of a foresight analysis of how these may develop in the next 6 years. It will highlight many of the key facilitators and inhibitors behind this change and the societal impacts caused as a result. This paper will synthesise the wide range of ethical, legal, social and economic impacts that may result from SDV use and implementation by 2025, such as issues of autonomy, privacy, liability, security, data protection, and safety. It will conclude with providing steps that we need to take to avoid these pitfalls, while ensuring we reap the benefits that SDVs bring. © 2019, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Ethics of self-driving vehicles; Philosophy of technology; Scenario foresight analysis; Self-driving cars

Planter performance depends on determining and utilizing optimal settings for different planting variables such as seed depth, down pressure, and seed metering unit. The evolution of “Big Data” in agriculture today brings focus on the need for quality as-planted and yield mapping data. Therefore, an investigation was conducted to evaluate the performance of current planting technology for accurate placement of seeds while understanding the accuracy of as-planted data. Two studies consisting of two different setups on a 6-row, John Deere planter for seeding of maize (Zea mays L.) were conducted. The first study aimed at assessing planter performance at 2 depth settings (25 and 51 mm) and four different down pressure settings (varying from none to high), while the second study focused on evaluating planter performance during variable-rate seeding with treatments consisting of two seed metering units (John Deere Standard and Precision Planting’s eSet setups) with five different seeding rates and four ground speed treatments which provided a combination of 20 different meter speeds. Field data collection consisted of measuring plant emergence, plant population and seed depth whereas plant spacing, plant population after emergence along with distance and location for rate changes within the field were also recorded for the variable-rate seeding study. Results indicated that both depth setting and downforce affected final seeding depth. Measured seed depth was significantly different from the target depth even though time was spent adjusting the units to achieve the desired prior to planting. Crop emergence did not vary significantly for the different depth and downforce settings except for target depth in Field 1. Results from the variable-rate study indicated that seeding rate changes were accomplished within a quick response time (< 1 s) at all ground speeds regardless of magnitude of rate change. Data showed that planter performance in terms of emergence and plant spacing CV was comparable for most of the meter speeds (17.4–33.5 rpm) among the two seed meters utilized in the study. Plant spacing CV increased with an increase in meter speed, however no significant differences existed among meter speeds in the range of 17.4–33.5 rpm. Results implied that correct seed metering unit setup is very critical to obtain expected performance of today’s planting technology. A concerning find was that the quality of as-applied maps from the commercial variable-rate display was not reflective of the actual planter performance in the field. The study recommended that operators need to ensure the correct planter and display setups in order to achieve needed seed placement performance to support variable-rate seeding. © 2019, The Author(s).",Downforce; Maize; Planter performance; Seed depth; Seed metering; Variable-rate

Although highlighting these benefits, smart factories also need to be sustainable and renewable in terms of energy. Estimations show that factory activities use about 35% of the entire global electricity supply, also producing about 20% of the total carbon emissions. In this context, this article analyzes the impact of energy on the scope of Industry 4.0. A systematic literature review was proposed exploring recent studies in smart manufacturing and energy consumption fields. The search was guided by research questions and based on PICOC (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and context) criteria. A group of articles was selected and evaluated with the intent to answer the inquiries. As a result, more than 2,500 papers published over the past ten years have been revised. Besides, the most critical topics in the sector of energy consumption in smart factories were pointed out, through a reliable method of selection of articles. The contributions consist of identifying open questions and challenges in the area, in addition to proposing a novel taxonomy to reorganize initiatives that correlate the use of energy and the new requirements of the Industry 4.0.

In return for the cost paid by cloud users, a variety of services have been provided for them, the quality of which has been guaranteed and the reliability of their corresponding resources have been supplied by cloud service providers. Due to the heterogeneity of resources and their several shared applications, efficient scheduling can increase the productivity of cloud resources. This will reduce users’ costs and energy consumption, considering the quality of service provided for them. Cloud resource management can be conducted to obtain several objectives. Reducing user costs, reducing energy consumption, load balancing of resources, enhancing utilization of resources, and improving availability and security are some of the key objectives in this area. Several methods have been proposed for cloud resource management, most of which are focused on one or more aspects of these objectives of cloud computing. This paper introduces a new framework consisting of multiple cooperative agents, in which, all phases of the task scheduling and resource provisioning is considered and the quality of service provided to the user is controlled. The proposed integrated model provides all task scheduling and resource provisioning processes, and its various parts serve the management of user applications and more efficient use of cloud resources. This framework works well on dependent simultaneous tasks, which have a complicated process of scheduling because of the dependence of its sub-tasks.

This study evaluates the productivity and resource use efficiency of different bioenergy crops and cropping systems using experimental and simulation modelling derived data. The field experiment consisted of two years, two sites differing in soil texture and soil water availability, different cropping systems and increasing nitrogen (N) supply. Continuous (two years) perennial ryegrass and two crop rotations including winter cover crops (double cropping system) and combining C4 and C3 crops were compared with continuous maize (maize–maize). The productivity of the crops and cropping systems in terms of dry matter (DM) yield was analyzed with respect to the fraction of light interception and light use efficiency (LUE). In addition, water use and water use efficiency (WUE), N uptake, and N use efficiency (NUE) were quantified. DM yield of the double cropping system was similar to that of continuous maize, due to a prolonged leaf area duration, compensating for the intrinsic lower LUE of C3 crops. Perennial ryegrass was less productive than the other crops/cropping systems. Nitrogen uptake and consequently N demand of perennial ryegrass and the C3 crops of the crop rotations were higher than for maize–maize. Groundwater recharge was mainly site-dependent, but was at both sites higher for maize than for the crop rotations or the perennial ryegrass system. Our results indicate that, in terms of biomass productivity, optimized rotations are feasible alternatives to maize–maize, but trade-offs exist in terms of water and N use efficiency. © 2018 by the authors.",Bioenergy; Biomass; Cropping systems; Grasses; Maize; Nitrogen use efficiency; Water use efficiency; Wheat

Labour productivity study is used in current practice to obtain the required cycle time of manual tasks. However, the reliability of labour productivity study in estimating durations of manual activities is inhibited by its dependence on various factors which change with the different working conditions of construction jobsites and the difficulties associated with measuring productivity. This study thus investigates the use of a predetermined motion time system (PMTS) for modelling manual construction operations for cycle time estimation and efficiency evaluation. A motion-level simulation approach is developed by integrating PMTS into discrete-event simulation (DES) modelling, providing an automated and simple-to-use method of analysing manual tasks. As a case study, manual construction operations from a construction jobsite with different levels of repetitiveness are modelled, and the actual and simulated cycle times are compared and analysed.

We explored an observational approach and initial diagnostics to enhance total system performance in robotic surgery. Methods: Eighty-nine robotic surgical cases were observed in multiple operating rooms using two different surgical robots (the S and Si), across several specialties (Urology, Gynecology, and Cardiac Surgery). The main measures were operative duration and rate of flow disruptions—described as ‘deviations from the natural progression of an operation thereby potentially compromising safety or efficiency.’ Contextual parameters collected were surgeon experience level and training, type of surgery, the model of robot and patient factors. Observations were conducted across four operative phases (operating room pre-incision; robot docking; main surgical intervention; post-console). Results: A mean of 9.62 flow disruptions per hour (95 % CI 8.78–10.46) were predominantly caused by coordination, communication, equipment and training problems. Operative duration and flow disruption rate varied with surgeon experience (p = 0.039; p < 0.001, respectively), training cases (p = 0.012; p = 0.007) and surgical type (both p < 0.001). Flow disruption rates in some phases were also sensitive to the robot model and patient characteristics. Conclusions: Flow disruption rate is sensitive to system context and generates improvement diagnostics.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a balancing method of both workstation time and station area to improve the efficiency and productivity of the robotic assembly lines.

Design/methodology/approach: This research proposes an optimal method for balancing robotic assembly lines with space consideration and reducing robot changeover and area for tools and fixtures to further minimize assembly line area and cycle time. Due to the NP-hard nature of the considered problem, an improved multi-objective immune clonal selection algorithm is proposed to solve this constrained multi-objective optimization problem, and a special coding scheme is designed for the problem. To enhance the performance of the algorithm, several strategies including elite strategy and global search are introduced. Findings: A set of instances of different problem scales are optimized and the results are compared with two other high-performing multi-objective algorithms to evaluate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

However, there are limited researches concerning both energy consumption reduction and productivity improvement on U-shaped robotic assembly lines. This paper first develops a nonlinear multi-objective mixed-integer programming model, reformulates it into a linear form by linearising the multiplication of two binary variables, and then refines the weight of multiple objectives so as to achieve a better approximation of true Pareto frontiers. In addition, Pareto artificial bee colony algorithm (PABC) is extended to tackle this new complex problem. This algorithm stores all the non-dominated solutions into a permanent archive set to keep all the good genes, and selects one solution from this set to overcome the strong local minima. Comparative experiments based on a set of newly generated benchmarks verify the superiority of the proposed PABC over four multi-objective algorithms in terms of generation distance, maximum spread, hypervolume ratio and the ratio of non-dominated solution. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",artificial bee colony; assembly line balancing; energy consumption reduction; multi-objective optimisation; U-shaped robotic assembly lines

However, the advent of additive manufacturing to print functional parts has expanded the possibilities for a hybrid approach in this field. Hybrid additive manufacturing is the combination of two or more manufacturing processes or materials that synergistically affect the quality and performance of a printed part. Hybrid additive manufacturing allows for advancements in material properties beyond efficiency and productivity. Mechanical, physical, and chemical properties can be designed and printed. The purpose of this study was to model a hybrid additive manufacturing process to investigate the resulting mechanical properties. Laser shock peening (LSP) was coupled with selective laser melting in a 2D finite element simulation in Abaqus to quantify the resulting residual stress fields.

In the field of additive manufacturing (AM) of large-scale metallic parts, combined technologies of these methods can offer advantageous solutions to manufacture complex parts with the industry’s economical requirements of productivity and energy efficiency. To study the feasibility of a combined DMD–PTA technique, a preliminary analysis in the specification of both techniques is conducted. Hybrid layers are fabricated using stainless steel EN X3CrNiMo13-4. Joining strategy of dissimilar layers, as well as microstructure and tensile strength of the hybrid layers, are examined. A comparison of the PTA and DMD process specifications shows both PTA and DMD processes are capable of being integrated into one operating system to enhance productivity. Layer-wise deposition of both processes presents a dense microstructure between dissimilar layers. However, side-by-side deposition of PTA and DMD layers requires proper joint-strategy due to higher heat input and wider and thicker deposited track in the regular current PTA compared to the DMD. The DMD layers exhibit higher hardness values compared to the PTA layer (300–315 HV and 320–350 HV, respectively) due to the smaller grain size. The tensile properties of the hybrid PTA-DMD layers are more comparable with PTA layer. The mean yield strengths of samples fabricated with the hybrid PTA-DMD layers are 800–850 MPa, while these properties are 794 MPa, and 984 MPa in samples made with PTA and DMD, respectively. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Direct metal deposition; High deposition rate additive manufacturing; Hybrid additive manufacturing; Plasma transfer arc welding

It allows producing the parts directly from 3D-model to 3D-object from metallic powders and alloys. Nowadays the method has very low productivity, which limits its extensive use and possible application to solve a modern design problem by introducing direct and fast metal production. The solution of its productivity would allow receiving metallic 3D-objects with complex geometry in short production period. The method was improved by the installation of laser beam profiling and online monitoring systems on the developed experimental setup. The profiler contributes to obtaining the alternative power density distributions of the laser beam. The CoCrMo powder was chosen because of its excellent melting qualities, and the initial powder was pre-treated with the purpose to get the diameter of the particles less than 20 μm. During the experiments, 3D-samples were obtained by the improved method of selective laser melting with parameters of two process windows for each of the laser beam spot. The 3D-samples were studied for the revelation of common material defects of the microstructure. The chemicalanalyses of the samples were implemented by scanning electronic microscopy. The analyses showed that the samples of each laser beam spot had defects related to the formation of a solid solution. Application of Inverse Gaussian laser beam spot into the SLM-machine for production of 3D-objects allows producing the pieces with the values of the parameters exceeding the value for Gaussian laser beam spot in several times. The typically recommended parameters for production of the piece on the modern SLM-machine are less than 100 W for laser source power and less than 30 mm/s for scanning speed. The analytical data, presented in the article demonstrated the field of process parameters, which can give a possibility to obtain 3D-object with the parameters up to 1 kW for laser source power and up to 0.3 m/s for scanning speed. The analyses of microstructure give a possibility to conclude about no visible difference between the formation of the objects with different laser beam spots. The online video-monitoring shows that with the application of laser beam profiling system the negative effects of the selective laser melting reduces visibly. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Additive manufacturing; Chemical analyzes; Diagnostics; Efficiency; Factors; Laser beam; Modeling; Monitoring; Parameters; Processing; Productivity; Profiling; Quality; Selective laser melting; SEM; Shaping; Temperature fields

The workpiece quality and the process productivity are strongly dependent both on the process parameters (wire feed speed, voltage and current) and on the selected deposition path. Currently, the CAM (Computer-Aided-Manufacturing) software dedicated to WAAM rely on a multi-pass strategy to create the component layers, i.e. each layer is built overlapping multiple welding passes. However, since WAAM can create wide layers, a single pass strategy can improve the process efficiency when dealing with thin walled components. This paper proposes CAM software dedicated to WAAM, using a single pass strategy. The proposed solution uses a midsurface representation of the workpiece as input, to generate the deposition toolpath. A feature recognition module is proposed, to identify the critical features of the part, such as free end walls, t-crossings, direct-crossings and isolated tubulars. A specific strategy is developed and proposed for each one of the selected features, with the aim of minimizing the geometrical errors and to ensure the required machining allowances for the subsequent finishing operations. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified manufacturing a test case. © 2018",Computer-aided-manufacturing; Feature recognition; Gas-Metal-Arc-Welding; Wire-Arc-Additive-Manufacturing

For this reason, producing a single product regardless of its geometric complexity has been noted as one of the key advantages of additive manufacturing (AM) in the literature. This paper, however, points out that designing assembly parts also has positive influences on AM productivity. In fact, assembly designs enable AM manufacturers to reduce the build time by lowering the height of parts, to decrease the material cost by reducing the amount of support, and to improve the surface quality by deciding the proper orientations for build-up parts. For applying to AM, we propose the assembly design procedure that includes two main phases: designing assembly parts employing design guidelines and evaluating the assembly parts with a quantitative method. In the guidelines for assembly designs, there are mainly two categories: (1) basic principles for assembly designs; and (2) connection types for part assemblies. The former deals with how we separate a single product into several parts and how we make a decision about a build-up orientation in order to improve the AM productivity. The latter covers connection methods that explain how divided parts are connected into a single product again. To assess the assembly part designs quantitatively, we suggest a simple estimation model based on the digital light processing (DLP), an AM technology that results in high efficiency in terms of the build time. A numerical example is provided to show how different assembly designs are compared to select the best one with the highest AM productivity. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.",

When choosing the technology for fixed dental structure manufacturing, three viable options are available (precise casting, milling and selective laser melting [SLM]). All these technologies can be used to produce a dental structure from CoCr alloy. Besides materials and availability of technologies, economic efficiency is an important factor when choosing a production method. The purpose of this study is to develop an estimation model for achievable productivity of selective laser melting and compare the results with the productivity of conventional manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach: Results presented in this paper are based on manufacturing time analysis of an individual case with each of the technologies mentioned above. Because of the efficiency of SLM is highly dependent on how efficiently the work space of the machine is used, this issue was also included in the research. Data used for research were acquired from practical use of each technology in dental applications. Findings: Analysis of achievable SLM manufacturing speeds is based on the previous research into manufacturing speeds of additive manufacturing technologies. The presented results present a model that can be used to estimate the productivity of the SLM technology. Research limitations/implications: Research was limited to a specific SLM machine type with a fixed workspace volume. Nevertheless, the results show that any SLM machine has to be used as efficiently as possible to be able to be competitive regarding the conventional manufacturing technologies. Practical implications: The presented results show clearly at least a rough estimation of what kind of parts and in what volume will be manufactured with an SLM machine prior to buying one. Social implications: Results can help to widen the economically efficient way of running SLM machines, replacing conventional manufacturing for medical applications especially with complicated cases. Originality/value: A method is presented to adapt the estimation model to a particular real-life production scenario.
